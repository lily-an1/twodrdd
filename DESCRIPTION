Description: This package allows the user to use nonparametric response surface 
    methods as well as methods using local linear regression to analyze two-
    dimensional regression discontinuity designs. These methods use the rddapp 
    and laGP packages extensively; code is also provided to generate data sets
    that was originally shared by Kristin Porter.
